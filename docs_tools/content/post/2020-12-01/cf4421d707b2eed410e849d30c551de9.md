Utah State Government's "Animal Crossover" (Social Media)

**Overseas.com, November 28, 2011**.
According to CNN (CNN) local time on the 27th, the Utah state government has built a wildlife "overpass" in order to protect local wildlife and reduce the risk of wildlife encountering traffic accidents on the highway. The bridge has reportedly seen initial results in a short period of time.

The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources reportedly began construction in 2018 on the bridge, which will be located on a local interstate highway to reduce wildlife-induced traffic accidents near Pare Canyon. In a video released by the Division last week, the bridge has been put into service to help wildlife such as moose, porcupines, deer and black bears safely cross the busy highway.

The access road is covered with a variety of rocks and logs to attract animals, and is a clever replacement for the highway. The bridge is reportedly scheduled to be operational in 2019, and state officials, who thought it would take years for the bridge to be put to real use, have been pleasantly surprised by the results.
