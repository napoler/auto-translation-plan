With the first rays of the morning sun

Meow stretches its back

After making your bed and washing up, you're ready to work for a living!

The meow is really a lively and energetic creature!

  

**No way! ***

The face is filled with anticipation for the job.

And the love of work

  

Just one year later

Why work?

Why do I always have to go to work?

Probably only 5 million small dried fish.

That's what makes me feel good, right?

  

Going with the Flow on the Way to Work

  

Going to work "refreshed"

  
  

What? Did the foreman call for me again?

Hey, if you don't move bricks, you won't be able to feed yourself.

  

  

The foreman also looks like he's still awake.

  

  

The boss had a bad pill last night.  

It means nothing.

  

  

  
This Kongshi eats date pills ah!
