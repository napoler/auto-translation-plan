 Pets can get a little carried away with their owners. Recently, a Shiba Inu who likes to sit and watch videos has gone viral on the Internet.

According to the introduction, the Shiba Inu, named Chiko, shocked everyone by indulging in watching videos at only 7 months old, while sitting upright on a bench.

According to his owner, Olesia
Kuzmychova said that Chiko started watching TV with Olesia the first day she got home from Olesia's house, and when Olesia went out, Olesia would also watch the TV so that Chiko could watch the show to her heart's content.

Day after day, Chiko also watches videos sitting in the same position as her owner, with cute little short legs.
