 Breed Determines Character

Every type of dog has something in common, so "breed determines personality". Most dog registries classify dogs according to their behavioral characteristics, instincts and family history. Currently, it is common worldwide to group dogs into seven distinctive categories: sporting dogs, hunting dogs with a keen sense of smell or sight, sheepdogs, working dogs, and dogs with a strong sense of smell or sight.
Dogs, Toy Dogs and Family Dogs.

Some are good at searching, others will pick up prey from the water or forest and bring it back to their owners (e.g., retriever), and the pointer will point out the location of birds. The Sheltie (setter) will also search for and indicate the location of birds, sometimes over long distances. The short-legged Spaniel prefers to move around its owner, perform small search tasks, and is capable of frightening and picking up prey.
