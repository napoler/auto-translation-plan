 # The more strange the breeding, the more the netizens adopted a short-legged little black dog, half a year later, it turned into a long-legged big-nosed dog!

Last June

The netizen Ms. Huang adopted a small earth dog from the Internet.

and named it Brown Sugar.

Brown sugar is only 20 centimeters long when it first arrives at home.

The little ones are especially cute.

But I didn't expect to keep it for only half a year or so.

It grew to over a meter in length.

The weight has also multiplied several times.

Compared to the other small dogs in the house

It's just over ten months old and already a third bigger than they are.

And the brown sugar looks a lot like a labrador!

Whether it's the shape of the face or the nose

If you don't look closely

It is indeed easy to mistake it for a Labrador!

It makes netizens wonder: are you really a small dirt dog?

Although there is no way to tell if brown sugar is labrador or not.

But brown sugar is very smart and extremely sticky.

Let the netizen family live happily every day.

And it was because my boyfriend's birthday wish was to adopt a dog.

That's why Miss Huang went to take the brown sugar home.

So she always felt she had found a treasure.

Brown Sugar: Hey, are you surprised? Are you surprised?
