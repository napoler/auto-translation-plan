 According to the news just released by Hong Kong Eastweb, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government said on 25 October that it received a poodle whose sample tested positive for the new coronavirus.

According to the department, the poodle is from Tsuen Wan and its owner is a close contact with a confirmed case of neocrowning, so the poodle was sent to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department for quarantine last Friday (20), and the sample taken showed positive results for neocrowning.

According to the report, however, the poodle does not currently show any signs of illness. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will continue to closely monitor the status of the poodle, and will conduct several tests.
