The family film "The Meow Star" directed by Chen Mucheng and starring Gutenberg, Mary Ma, Liu Chutian, Huang Xingvis, etc. will be released on July 7, 2017 during the summer season nationwide. The movie tells the story of the "Meow Star Guest" Rhinoceros, who comes to Earth in a spaceship and unwittingly becomes the new member of the Kutian Le and Mary's family and the series of hilarious stories that follow. The latest promotional video, "The Evolution of the Meow Star", recently released by the movie, is a true and comprehensive reproduction of the cat's cute, cold, playful, clingy and other characteristics, which resonates with the cat slaves.  

  

 **The newest video, "The Evolution of Meowth," has been released by the company.

  

In "The Evolution of Meow", all kinds of meowing creatures do not want to be just a cute pet, so they start a long journey of super meow evolution. In the video, the meowers are so good at being cute and spoiled, they can even read and dance to send signals to their home planet, and they can even drive a horse and kill a chicken without any difficulty.

  

As the absolute protagonist of "The Meow Star", Rhinoceros Li represents the history and tradition of the strongest meowing creatures, and occupies a world of its own with her all-powerful superpowers and her unique personality. In the face of the family's pleasures, Rhinoceros is a cool, indifferent look, demonstrating what it means to use "one expression to express 10,000 emotions" in superb acting. He is also the most popular meow in history.

  

 **The most important thing to do is to make sure that you have the right tools to do it.

  

I'm used to the "fat" meow, but this is the first time I've ever encountered the "big" meow. After the arrival of the rhinoceros on earth, the family went from "scared" to "too much trouble" to "too little trouble" when faced with the life-size "Magic Cat". "All love" can truly feel the love and trust between humans and their pets. Sister Liu Chutian is the first person to embrace the rhinoceros rhinoceros, the rhinoceros rhinoceros as a best friend. Brother ovis ammon also love the rhinoceros rhinoceros can't put it down, off-camera said straight home must have a cat.

  

For the rhinoceros rhinoceros outside cold inside hot character, Gutenberg also had some insights: although unpredictable, but sometimes the things done will make people think it is very considerate, such as sad, the cat will be quietly accompanied by the side. For example, a cat will stay quietly with you when you are sad. I believe that many cat slaves can understand the warmth of the cat's heart. Therefore, director Chen Mucheng turned these concepts into a movie in order to make more people feel the warmth between family and pets in addition to making it funny.

  

It is reported that "The Meowth" will be released nationwide on July 7, 2017.
