 Galactic Combat 2 has officially aired, and in this story we see the appearance of the mysterious Tartarus. Of course, in the first story, Tartarus did nothing more than praise the Land of Light, and then disappeared again. The most miserable character in the first story is Max, who is not very lucky and encounters the Slann, the fiercest beast Herberos, the serpent Morgul, and Gordis.

In the preview of the second story, Gothic Ultraman and Justus Ultraman finally appear, a pair that hasn't been on stage together since they fought side by side in the theatrical version of Gothic Ultraman. This year is also the year that Jestis Ultraman reappears after 18 years, so it's definitely a big surprise for fans. In order to rescue Max Altman, Mr. Eddy also gathered a large number of Ultraman soldiers to help Max Altman.

This time, Gauss and Justice met the boss of Rob Ultraman, Rugset, also known to fans as the Rainbow Dragon. The Rainbow Dragon is a powerful force in the story of Rob Ultraman, as he is caught in the middle of a violent rampage because of the Old Trust. In the first episode of Galactic Fight 2, Eddie Altman fought him, but he couldn't kill him. And in this still we see Gauss in his futuristic form and Justus in his shattered form, and it looks like the Rainbow Dragon is going to be killed, just wondering if Tartarus will come to the rescue!

There is no information as to whether or not Regedo Ultraman will make an appearance, and there is no information that Regedo will make an appearance. But that doesn't mean it's impossible, because Tartarus was in action when Gauss and Justus fought the Rainbow Dragon. This moment is actually the best time for Regedo to make an appearance, both to save everyone and to let Tartarus go off to the next story to make things happen, but of course even if Regedo does appear, he won't kill Tartarus directly, since he is the main character in three stories!

The two Ultraman who appeared here last time were Cyrus and Leo. It seems that the preparations to save Max are almost complete, now all that is needed is the antibody in Hikari's hand, Max senior you hold on a little longer!
