"Prosecutor, I am too aggrieved, just picked up a cat, but was told by the public security organs to break the law, really people sitting at home, misfortune from heaven ah." A few days ago, Li Mou went to the prosecutor's office in Gusi County and said.

In the early morning hours of November, Li Mou went to a restaurant and packed a barbecue, and sat on the roadside to eat, and the scent caught the attention of a cat next to him. The cat ran to Li and called, he fed the cat some food, looked at the poor cat and carried it home. A few days later, the police station police found Mr. Li and said he was suspected of theft and had been investigated. The original cat is a breed of cat, lost, its owner reported it to the police, after the police investigation and view surveillance video, and finally determined is by Li Mou "steal" away the cat.
