The most important food for dogs can be said to be non-dog food, that comes in second is snacks, some people think snacks are unnecessary, but we humans also like to eat when nothing spicy chips and other snacks, not to mention the dog it? Eating a staple food is too single, and over time, the dog may become disliked to eat, and it will also make it feel bad. But after all, snacks are supplemental food, and many new shovelers still don't know about snacks, and some of the wrong feedings may cause anorexia and picky eating, so let me, an experienced shoveler, share my knowledge about snacks with you!

Snack selection

There are many types of dog snacks, in addition to the high rate of purchase of chicken jerky, beef and other meat food, there are some functional snacks, such as bite-resistant bone snacks can assist dogs to pass the time, boredom also has the effect of cleaning teeth, the Kerry home teething bar is a very good product, it can be strong teeth, clean breath, teething bar inside the layers of buffalo hide wrapped around the outside of the chicken package It is a natural meat flavor, tough, chewy and durable, and can prevent your dog from tearing the furniture while cleaning his teeth.

Give the proper snacks.

If the snacks are fed too often and in too large a quantity, it is likely to cause the dog to be anorexic and picky, because what the dog eats also has a certain amount of nutrition, most of the snacks are very single nutrition, while the nutrition of the dog food will be more balanced. So if we only give them a snack every day and not the main meal, the dog's body will have very little nutrition. So try to give them snacks when you praise them, not only to give them a treat, but also to help them learn their skills as quickly as possible.

Training Your Dog with Snacks

Some dogs have a strong sense of sovereignty and will become disobedient if they are not trained from an early age, so it is necessary to train your dog, snacks can bring pleasure to your dog and reward him with a snack when he obeys you, and he will gradually become well-behaved and obedient. Snacks can also calm down some scared or overreacting dogs, allowing them to relax and reduce stress. Snacking can also increase the bond between the dog and its owner, making the relationship better.

Owning a dog is not easy, since the choice, the owner must first make a good plan, I believe we will all raise a dog has been well behaved and sensible!
