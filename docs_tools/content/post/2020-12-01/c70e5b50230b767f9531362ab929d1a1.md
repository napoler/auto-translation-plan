A survey has found that the price of puppies from Britain's most popular breed has reached record levels, according to the website of Sky News UK. According to the data, the average price of a Dachshund rose to £1,838 in June this year, up 89 percent from £973 in March. English and French bulldog prices have also risen sharply. A review of the past three years of advertising on some of Britain's largest classified advertising sites shows that the prices of English pugs, dachshunds and poodles have never been higher. According to the report, the rise in puppy prices is due to a spike in demand for puppies following the March 23rd announcement of a nationwide lockdown in the UK, when millions of people began working from home. Since that day, Google searches for "buy a puppy" have increased 166 percent.
