 Dui, a Vietnamese dog, has quickly become popular on the Internet because it looks like a cat and is very cute, with netizens calling it "the funniest ball of fur" and speculating about its breed, according to a Feb. 26 report in the British newspaper Metro.

Dui is a cross between a Corgi and a Vietnamese Hmong dog, and some joked that he might be a mix of a Corgi and an English Shorthair.
Anh and Tuan said, "Two-and-a-half-month-old Dui is actually a cross between a native Vietnamese dog and a short-legged dog named Dingo." Dui was purchased by his owner, Tuan, in a mountainous area of Vietnam, so it's possible that he has a genetic mutation that causes him to look like a cat, but Dui is a very happy and lovable dog who loves to play with other dogs and is happy with his humans.

It's only been five days since Tuan created his own page for Dui online, and already he has over 40,000 likes, and the dog has many fans around the world, with one user even writing a poem about him. (Compiled and reported by China Youth Network)
