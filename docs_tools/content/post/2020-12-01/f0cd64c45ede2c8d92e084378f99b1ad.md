title: ' Linda H. Gay admits to being in love with Lin Feng? A video of a kiss, with
  a message later is the person who has dog food to spread '
---

 Recently, the two actresses Lin Huan and Yue Hsi Gay were photographed together at a dinner party, and their relationship is suspected to be exposed.

It's the first time I've ever been in a position to do this.

It is the first time I have ever been to a school. In the video, Yueh-Hsi Gai is holding a Corgi, which is probably her own pet, and as soon as the dog came to Yuehsi's arms, it started licking her mouth.

The video's accompanying text reads, "I am also a person who spreads dog food.

Many netizens are speculating that it is not a side response to the love affair with Lin Hai. It is well known that there is another name for him, which is "Lim Dog".

It is also known that there is a tree behind the video, which means "forest", and the corgi in Yuehsi's arms is a dog, which means "forest dog". It's not a problem when you think about it, but the word "forest" is a bit far-fetched.

Although both parties have not responded positively to this, sending this kind of video is like poking and prodding.

I wish them well.
