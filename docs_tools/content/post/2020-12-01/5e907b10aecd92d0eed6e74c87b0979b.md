 The Daily Mail published an anecdote on Feb. 13 about a dog owner in Las Vegas, Nevada, who aimed a gun at his Beagle and fired two shots.

In the video, the hostess poses with her thumb, index finger and middle finger in the shape of a gun and dubs herself "Bang! Bang!" The dog is very cooperative and emotional, howling twice as the owner "shoots," as if imitating the sad scene in a gunfight movie where the main character is shot and about to collapse, and then collapses on the mat next to her.

Later, when the owner approached to check on the dog, the dog accidentally exposed itself and peeked at the owner with its eyes wide open, a cute and mischievous look. (Editor: Jin Yixin, Editor: Liu Yang)
