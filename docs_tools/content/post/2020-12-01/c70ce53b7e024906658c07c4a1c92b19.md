 Original title: dog lost 2 hours later actually was skinned by people do not know how to say to the 2-year-old son ......

Photo of lost corgi and young owner.

The owner recognized the TOTO by the head pattern.

On the morning of April 6th, Ms. Li of Chengdu lost her Corgi that she had raised for two years. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that. He grew up with my son. I don't know how to tell my 2-year-old son that TOTO will never come back."

**Pet circle goes wild: corgi is being skinned**

At noon on the 6th, Ms. Ren, a citizen of Chengdu, sent a friend to say, "I'm shaking." The photo is accompanied by several pictures of corgi dogs. In one of them, there is a dead dog hanging in a tree, bloodstained, next to a black garbage bag. The pictures were so bloody, it was almost impossible to tell it was a dog. According to Ms. Ren, these pictures were sent to a pet dog WeChat group in Chengdu. "This morning, a group of friends of the corgi ran away and lost, the owner's family searched for several hours, found. But it has been skinned." Ms. Ren said.
