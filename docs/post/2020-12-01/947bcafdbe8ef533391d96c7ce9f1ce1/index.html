<p>There are a lot of rich people in the pet world, and there is a number one price tag.
The $375 million German Shepherd, Gunther IV, and also Toby Rimes, the dog world&rsquo;s celebrity poodle, are worth $12 million, one rich and the other impeccably beautiful.</p>

<p>WEALTH</p>

<p>Unlike them, today&rsquo;s story is about a dog who is famous not only for his wealth, but also for his surprising way of being spoiled, for his owner who left a huge inheritance to his dog but not to his grandchildren, which is also the origin of his owner&rsquo;s nickname &ldquo;the queen of miserliness&rdquo;.</p>

<p>(Arrogance, greed, miserliness, power, wealth, tax evasion and jail time - that&rsquo;s what people think of Henrianna Helmsley of the New York Hotel)</p>

<p>After her death in August 2007, the disposition of the large fortune she left behind, leaving aside the events of Leona&rsquo;s life, came as a shock.</p>

<p>According to her will, which was made public on August 28, the largest beneficiary of Leona&rsquo;s estate was not a person, but her beloved dog, a Maltese named Trouble.</p>

<p>The $12 million bequest to her own pet female dog named Trouble stunned many Americans at one point.</p>

<p>In her will, Leona designated a $12 million credit fund for Trouble, who received more than any of Leona&rsquo;s relatives.</p>

<p>Leona also left a will stating that in the event of Trouble&rsquo;s death, she would bury it near her. This shows the extent to which Leona doted on The Troubles.</p>

<p>But Leona was not so generous to her own family. For example, one of her brothers and two of her sons receive millions of dollars each, but his brother has to assume guardianship of the Troubles.</p>

<p>The two sons are required to visit their dead father&rsquo;s grave at least once a year, or they don&rsquo;t get any money. The other two grandchildren are completely excluded from the will.</p>

<p><strong>&gt; &gt;&gt;Expensive Care Fees&lt;&lt;</strong>&lt;</p>

<p>In the last years of his life, Trouble lived a carefree life every day.</p>

<p>It was revealed that the hotel that took care of him spent up to $100,000 a year, including $8,000 for health care, $1,200 for food, and the remaining $90,000 for a team of bodyguards to provide 24-hour security, as well as the salaries of caretakers, veterinarians, and other staff.</p>

<p>When the news of Trouble&rsquo;s death came to light, the question of who would inherit his vast fortune immediately became the center of attention.</p>

<p>However, Leona&rsquo;s will had already stipulated that, in the event of Trouble&rsquo;s death, all of his assets would be donated to charity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Troubles died last December at the age of 12, the equivalent of 84 years of human life.</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics of the type of Trouble</strong></p>

<p><strong>Variety</strong></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Trouble&rdquo; belongs to the Maltese, one of the oldest breeds of dogs in Europe originating from the Mediterranean region of the Middle Ages, originating from the Mediterranean island of Malta, a British dependency. and Mr. Love. The Maltese is one of the most famous as well as one of the most popular bear breeds.</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>&gt; &gt;Personality&lt;&lt;</strong>&lt;</p>

<p>The Maltese is an intelligent, lively, and gentle dog that will follow its owner at every step of the way, alert, but not barking.</p>

<p>&gt; *<em>&gt; &gt;Breeding&lt;&lt;</em></p>

<p>The Maltese loves to go for walks and generally doesn&rsquo;t get into trouble in public.</p>

<p>Its beautiful, long but also heavy coat requires a lot of time for regular care.</p>

<p>The Maltese is popular in high society.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth I mentioned them frequently in official documents, immortalizing this fascinating breed in the early history of art.</p>

<p>In 1864, Birmingham, England, hosted the first Maltese fraternity, and the breed became universally popular in all walks of life.</p>

<p><strong>Film Origins</strong></p>

<p>Dogs have always been man&rsquo;s faithful friends, and many movies have introduced the love of dogs, and &ldquo;10 Promises for Dogs and Me&rdquo; is a good one.</p>

<p>Xiao Guang and &ldquo;Socks&rdquo; met by chance.</p>

<p>She was only 12 years old at the time, and her father, a doctor, was busy at work and rarely came home. Xiaoguang was only living with her mother.</p>

<p>Suddenly, one day, her mother was seriously ill and hospitalized, and at this moment of uncertainty, a golden retriever came into her world, as if God knew her loneliness and helplessness and kindly sent it to keep her company. The puppy&rsquo;s feet had a patch of white fur, so she named it &ldquo;Socks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Before her mother died, she said to Xiao Qing, &ldquo;You must keep the ten promises you made to your dog. Love it, take care of it, and stay with it until it grows old, and never leave it.</p>

<p>The socks seemed to have a magical power to warm up Xiao Guang&rsquo;s heart, which had become cold with grief, and accompanied Xiao Guang through the youthful years of his life.</p>

<p>As she grew up, she left Hokkaido for Sapporo with her father and parted with her socks. As time went by, Kohaku took the socks back, and everything seemed to be going in a brighter direction. However, with his busy career and dating boyfriends, there was no room for &ldquo;socks&rdquo; in his life.</p>

<p>The father gave up his job at the hospital for Xiao Guang, and concentrated on compensating his daughter.</p>

<p>Until one day, her father called to say that her socks were getting worse and worse, and she was sleeping longer and longer. &hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>A dog&rsquo;s lifespan is only ten years, and in the blink of an eye, ten years have passed. Xiao Guang finally cried out in pain. Unfortunately, none of us can go back.</p>

<p>Due to this particular year, it&rsquo;s no longer a new thing for dogs to stay home and starve to death.</p>

<p>Most people have faith in the future, but that doesn&rsquo;t include another group of people - that is, the <strong>remaining</strong> pets in the home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save my child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help, my dog is starving to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was quarantined, my dog is still in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then such a group of people stepped forward.</p>

<p>They dressed up, brought water and food, and traveled through the empty city streets, shoveling and feeding dogs and cats, and even pet pigs, rats, reptiles and fish.</p>

<p>With the pet owner&rsquo;s permission, they broadcast the entire rescue operation live. When you open the door, many rooms are already full of feces, and some pets are even dying, if you are late &hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>When we adopt or purchase a pet, we must be highly responsible! Think of it as family!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some advice on how to get a dog.</p>

<p><strong>Dog Survival Manual (dry)</strong></p>

<p>If you want to have a dog, you must take responsibility for it, and next, a few dog-related tips and considerations.</p>

<p>*<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Considerations&lt;&lt;&lt;</em></p>

<p>(Image courtesy of Jane Books)</p>

<p>*<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Purchase Location&lt;&lt;&lt;</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s best to just take it straight from the home when the dog&rsquo;s mother has her baby&hellip; it&rsquo;s the most reliable way to go!</p>

<p>Why: Puppies are exposed to less germs from the outside world, so they don&rsquo;t breed excess disease, and domestic dog owners are more careful and will eat hygienically.</p>

<p>** Be sure not to buy any dog from a street vendor, and be sure not to go to an unexamined, unqualified dog factory to buy a dog! ***</p>

<p>*<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Details of dog selection&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</em></p>

<p>1: The eyes are clear and the pupils are lucent. If the dog&rsquo;s corneas are cloudy, the white spots may be distemper or infectious hepatitis.</p>

<p>2:A healthy dog&rsquo;s nose is moist, slightly cool and clean! Carefully check your dog&rsquo;s nose for discharge, if it&rsquo;s dry, runny, and has discharge, the chances of having a disease are very high!</p>

<p>3:The ears of a healthy dog are clean and sensitive, check to see if they are clean and do not smell.</p>

<p>*<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Vaccines and Worming&lt;&lt;&lt;</em></p>

<p>It usually takes 45-50 days before a dog can be vaccinated, so if you buy a dog that&rsquo;s about a month or two old, it&rsquo;s most likely not vaccinated.</p>

<p>After asking, go home and observe your dog for 7-10 days to make sure he&rsquo;s healthy and disease free and get 3-4 shots, once every 15-21 days.</p>

<p>(Remember to walk and bathe your dog after all vaccinations have been given).</p>

<p>(Remember that until six months, keeping the dog alive is more important than anything else, and no amount of care can be too great.)</p>

<p>Dogs should be dewormed internally 2 to 3 weeks after birth, then after 50 days, and every 3 months thereafter.</p>

<p>The amount of deworming medicine should be decided according to the dog&rsquo;s weight, the specific dosage can ask the local veterinarian.</p>

<p>*<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Tips&lt;&lt;&lt;</em></p>

<p><strong>1: Dog poop tests the quality of dog food</strong></p>

<p>Good dog food: Although it doesn&rsquo;t look oily, the poop is shiny, high in meat content, heavy in color, shaped, and moderately firm.</p>

<p>Sub-good dog food: the stool is dry, loose in texture, and light in color, which means that the amount of intake is too high, but the nutrition is not enough.</p>

<p><strong>2: Feeding regularly</strong></p>

<p>Do not accumulate food or fasting, which is not good for the dog&rsquo;s absorption and causes malnutrition.</p>

<p>The right amount of probiotics can exercise the dog&rsquo;s stomach absorption ability, pay attention to let the dog develop a good eating habits, form a regular reflex, secrete gastric juice, increase appetite, promote digestion and absorption, so that the dog&rsquo;s physical health will be very good.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you do your homework before buying a dog, if you buy a sick dog, then you either feel guilty about abandoning it, or spend a lot of money to save a low chance of survival.</p>
