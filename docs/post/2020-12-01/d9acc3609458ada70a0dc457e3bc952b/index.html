<p>In rural areas</p>

<p>Many people like to have dogs.</p>

<p>Used as a &ldquo;house keeper&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dogs are more humane though.</p>

<p>But injuries do happen.</p>

<p>Dogs biting poultry is a common occurrence.</p>

<p>In the event of such an event</p>

<p>How should I be compensated?</p>

<p>Basic facts</p>

<p>In February 2020, Quanzhou County, a township in Quanzhou County, more than dog bites chicken and ducks, villagers will squat in the chicken farm, and then found the dog to bite the chicken, so the dog tracked to the Wen Mou home, after the villagers reported, the police processing, the organization of the two sides to negotiate unsuccessfully, then Wen Mou will sell the dog and does not admit that he is the dog, so the village Zhong Mou, He Mou and other 8 people will v. Wen Mou to Quanzhou County. The court required the dog owner, Wen, to bear the liability and compensate Zhong Mou, He Mou and 8 other people for the economic loss of 150 chickens, ducks and geese totaling 15,200 yuan.</p>

<p>The court held that</p>

<p>The defendant is the breeder or manager of the dog, and he is the owner of the dog. According to common sense, the defendant should be the breeder or manager of the dog, and according to the police station law enforcement recorder video shows, the defendant Wen Mou to the dog by the fact of its breeding did not deny, also recognized the dog on February 24, the fact that the chicken bite to death, so the court found that the dog on February 24 dog bites the chicken is the defendant&rsquo;s dog. And identified by the villagers, a few times before the dog and the February 24 chicken dog bite the same two dogs, for the defendant bred a black dog, a yellow dog. And the defendant as the two dog breeders, failed to do the corresponding management responsibilities, shall bear the corresponding liability. The plaintiff claims that according to the market price of 100 yuan/chicken, duck, goose 175 yuan/goose to compensate for its economic losses, but consider the different size of the chicken, duck and goose, and other factors, need to approve their losses.</p>

<p>The court ruled that</p>

<p>The defendant Mr. Wen paid 13,680 yuan to Mr. Zhong, Mr. He and other 8 people as compensation.</p>

<p>Legal Links</p>

<p>Article 78 of the Tort Liability Law of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China: Where the breeding of animals causes damage to others, the breeder or manager shall bear the tort liability, but if it can be proved that the damage is caused by intentional or gross negligence of the tortfeasor, the liability can be waived or reduced.</p>

<p>January 1, 2021.</p>

<p>The forthcoming Civil Code</p>

<p>Liability for Damage to Feeding Animals</p>

<p>There are also clear rules</p>

<p>The Civil Code</p>

<p>Article 1245 Where the breeding animals cause damage to others, the animal breeder or manager shall bear the tort liability; however, if it can be proved that the damage is caused by the infringed person intentionally or by gross negligence, the liability may be waived or reduced.</p>

<p>Article 1246
If the animal breeder or manager fails to take safety measures for the animal in violation of management regulations and causes damage to others, the animal breeder or manager shall bear the tort liability; however, if it can be proved that the damage is intentionally caused by the infringed person, the liability may be reduced.</p>

<p>Article 1247 Where the breeding of dangerous animals such as strong dogs is prohibited and causes damage to others, the animal breeder or manager shall bear the tort liability.</p>

<p>Keeping animals is a citizen&rsquo;s freedom</p>

<p>But the animals you keep hurt people.</p>

<p>You have to take responsibility for it.</p>

<p>There are a few other things that happen in life</p>

<p>For example, if you are walking a baby and hit your dog.</p>

<p>Zoo Animal Injuries</p>

<p>Stray dogs and cats that hurt people</p>

<p>Who should be held accountable?</p>

<p>The Civil Code</p>

<p>Article 1248 Where the animals of a zoo cause damage to others, the zoo shall bear tort liability; however, if it can prove that it has fulfilled its management responsibilities, it shall not bear tort liability.</p>

<p>Article 1249 Where an abandoned or escaped animal causes damage to others during the period of abandonment or escape, the original keeper or manager of the animal shall bear the tort liability.</p>

<p>Judges&rsquo; Tips</p>

<p>The principle of no-fault liability applies to the damage caused by breeding animals. Therefore, in daily life, breeders need to be more restrained, never because the animal crosses the red line of the law, the loss does not outweigh the gain.</p>
