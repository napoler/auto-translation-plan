<p>**Conversation / words / civil / police why detained 5 people? ***</p>

<p>On March 28, reporters from the Chengdu Public Security Bureau Longquanyi District Branch was informed that the bureau recently handled a case of using the Internet to threaten the personal safety of others and spread the privacy of citizens, and arrested five people involved in the offense. For the police to deal with, as well as the concerns of netizens, the police made the following responses -</p>

<p>The newest addition to the family is the newest addition to the family.</p>

<p>The company&rsquo;s products have been sold in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

<p>The company&rsquo;s website is also a good place to start.</p>

<p>The police: the public security organs, He so-and-so will others lost corgi for his own possession, refused to return, is an act of appropriation, the public security organs in time to inform the parties can lawfully to the people&rsquo;s court to file a civil lawsuit on the matter, and actively set up a communication and consultation platform for the parties concerned to promote the resolution of the incident.</p>

<p>Reporter: After the incident on January 11, why did the police accept the case on February 7 and 10, and why did they not punish the detainee until March 27?</p>

<p>Civilian Police.
On January 11, after receiving the police report, the public security organs quickly dispatched the police and carried out the investigation work such as inquiry and visit, according to the situation, the same day, promptly set up a communication and consultation platform for both parties, informing Wu of the legal way to protect their rights and interests.

The company&rsquo;s products have been sold in the U.S. and Europe, and the company has been able to sell its products in the U.S. for more than a year.</p>

<p>Reporter: It is said that the police on January 14, a woman who threw paint on the residence of He Moumou made a detention punishment, can you tell us more about the case?</p>

<p>Civilian Police.
On January 13 at 16:00, the police received a report that &ldquo;someone in the Shangcheng Dongjin District sprayed paint on the door of the owner&rsquo;s house, abusing others,&rdquo; the police station police rushed to the scene and brought six suspects back to the police station for investigation. In the event that you have a good idea of what you&rsquo;re looking for, you&rsquo;ll be able to find the best way to get the most out of the situation. According to Article 26, Item 4 of the Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, Jia Mou&rsquo;s behavior has constituted a provocation and provocation, our bureau on January 14, according to the law, the offender Jia Mou administrative detention for six days of punishment, the remaining five people according to the circumstances and consequences of the illegal act, a reprimand.

<p>Police: The facts of the offense, the basis for punishment and the outcome of the case have been clearly explained to the three people. I would like to emphasize again the warning significance of this case, which can be considered a case by case argument. The five people in the case were all dealt with by the public security authorities in accordance with the law for committing illegal acts via the Internet, which shows once again that the Internet is not a place outside the law, and that individual citizens must abide by the law in everything they say and do in cyberspace, and must not commit illegal acts. Otherwise, they will be punished by law.</p>

<p>** on / words / when / things / people want to take a lesson not to forward the privacy of others **!</p>

<p>On March 28, in the Longquanyi District Detention Center, Mr. Li, who was interviewed, kept his head down. Mr. Li is an information blogger in Chengdu, with more than 100,000 followers on his microblog. He never thought that two months ago, a short 200-word microblog would have such a big impact on his life.</p>

<p>Another female user, who was involved in the &ldquo;human flesh&rdquo; dog wrestling, repeatedly asked reporters to do something about the sound of her interview because she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t want more people around her to know about it.</p>

<p>The company&rsquo;s website is the largest of its kind in the world.
Covered news reporters talked to the two netizens who were administratively detained for using the Internet to spread their privacy&hellip;</p>

<p>Reporter: What did you do in the &ldquo;dog fall incident&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I have sent screenshots of the WeChat that the person (Wu) sent me, the residential address of He Mou and her WeChat signal to Weibo.</p>

<p>Reporter: Have you ever thought that this kind of forwarding might be against the law?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to have a good idea of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>Reporter: How did she (Wu) find you, what did she say to you?</p>

<p>Li Mou: After losing the dog, its owner, Wu Mou, sent me a private message on Weibo asking me to repost it, and I didn&rsquo;t agree. But some time later, Mr. Wu asked me to forward it again. I published a microblogging service out of kindness, which contains private information such as He&rsquo;s address.</p>

<p>Reporter: When did you find out that your actions violated the law and how do you view your actions? Mr. Li: It wasn&rsquo;t until the police found me that I realized I had done a bad thing with good intentions. I hope that people will not be like me in the future, freely forwarding other people&rsquo;s private information.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the female netizen also expressed remorse for her actions, &ldquo;Through the education of the police, I realized the mistakes I made, and I will definitely abide by the law and not cross the legal bottom line.&rdquo; (Reporter Li Fengchun He Fandi Yu Ting Tian Road)</p>
