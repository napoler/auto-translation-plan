In Kajang, Malaysia, in order to control stray dogs, a dog catching team was sent to the street to catch stray dogs&hellip;.
But unlike other stray dogs, which would run away as soon as they saw someone chasing them, five of them not only didn&rsquo;t run away, but also surrounded a homeless man sleeping on the ground&hellip;.">

<p>Report</p>

<p>Recently, there was a photo that sparked a lot of discussion on the net.</p>

<p>In Kajang, Malaysia, in order to control stray dogs, a dog catching team was sent to the street to catch stray dogs&hellip;.</p>

<p>But unlike other stray dogs, which would run away as soon as they saw someone chasing them, five of them not only didn&rsquo;t run away, but also surrounded a homeless man sleeping on the ground&hellip;.</p>

<p>It was as if a group of bodyguards were guarding the owner.</p>

<p>Some netizens speculated that this homeless man should feed the dogs from time to time, and have a relationship with these dogs, so the dogs took him as their master.</p>

<p>Instead, he stayed to protect his &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It is known that if these stray dogs are not adopted within 7 days, they may be humanely destroyed, i.e. euthanized.</p>

<p>This way of rounding up stray dogs has also been condemned by many netizens, who hope that the local community can deal with the stray dog problem in a more humane way.</p>

<p>When it comes to stray dogs, there are always some people clamoring for a dog problem, to kill all the clouds, if there are dog owners walking their dogs off leash, or free-range dogs, hurting innocent passers-by, the result is to arrest the stray dogs&hellip;.</p>

<p>If a civilized city is not selected, it is also the fault of stray dogs&hellip;.</p>

<p>Stray dogs are the original sin and should not exist.</p>

<p>** But what did the dog do wrong? If it had a home, who would want to stray? ***</p>

<p>Even if the home may not seem like a home at all to others&hellip;.</p>

<p>If the definition of a home is a dog, then these five dogs should have a home, even if their &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is a homeless man.</p>

<p>A homeless man in Brazil was picked up by an ambulance after suffering a stroke, and the ambulance was followed by six dogs&hellip;.</p>

<p>When he was taken to the hospital, the dogs were in front of the hospital, howling and calling.</p>

<p>The dogs stayed at the hospital door for more than 24 hours after that&hellip;.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the next day when they were discharged from the hospital that they were so overjoyed they couldn&rsquo;t stop whimpering&hellip;.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t really have a home, but they treated each other like family.</p>

<p>When a friend went to the hospital, the hospital nurse noticed four more dogs at the door&hellip;.</p>

<p>They were all standing in front of the door, keeping their eyes on the same figure.</p>

<p>It turned out that the street urchin wasn&rsquo;t alone, he had four worried and anxious family members!</p>

<p>It is understood that the four dogs are stray dogs he took in, although he had a meal without a meal, but he always fed the dogs first, before eating himself.</p>

<p>The nurse was also touched, he also found that the dogs are very clean and healthy, their owners must be very good to them&hellip;.</p>

<p>After the dogs stayed at the door for half an hour, the hospital agreed to let them in to keep their owners company.</p>

<p>Even though life is not rich, the love that this man and his dogs give to each other is as strong as any emotion!</p>

<p>For dogs, where their owners are, it&rsquo;s home.</p>
