<p><strong>02</strong></p>

<p><strong>Body Language of Dogs</strong></p>

<p>For a fur baby who can&rsquo;t talk, <strong>not being able to communicate with you smoothly must be a big disappointment</strong>*.
They have a wide range of needs and ideas, but they express them in a variety of ways. But they have a variety of ways to express all kinds of needs and ideas. Let&rsquo;s see if you really know your four-legged fur baby.</p>

<p><strong>1 Dusk. Happy</strong>.</p>

<p>The most common one would be the tail wagging it, and I believe that everyone who owns a dog has experienced the beautiful moment of coming home from work and opening the door to be pounced on by a tail-wagging meatball. No doubt, seeing you must be the highlight of his day, so he will often!
<strong>wag its tail</strong> (wag its tail); if you are happy to watch him, he will <strong>jump up</strong> (jump up) <strong>cling to</strong> (cling to)
(picking) your leg, <strong>circle</strong> (circle) around you, or even happily <strong>run around</strong> (run around); if he&rsquo;s happier, you can hear him talking-.
<strong>bark</strong> (bark) <strong>, mock growl</strong> (pretend growl).</p>

<p><strong>2. Playing together</strong>.</p>

<p>If the dog <strong>bows down with its front lowered</strong> (front half of body on the ground) <strong>and its rear in the air
With tail wagging</strong>, he is saying I love you and inviting you to play with him. This is the time to drop what you&rsquo;re doing for a while and have fun with him!</p>

<p><strong>3 Dusk. Bare stomach</strong>.</p>

<p>Dogs generally like to <strong>lie on its stomach</strong> (lie down), but will <strong>roll over if it says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or because it feels safe and happy!
onto its back</strong> <strong>and display its belly</strong>. <strong>It wants its
belly rubbed as well</strong> (he also wants you to touch his belly, which is commonly known as jerking off).</p>

<p><strong>4. uneasy</strong>*.</p>

<p>If the dog <strong>lays its ears close to its head with narrowing eyes</strong> (puts its ears down close to its head with narrowing eyes**),
<strong>and its body is held low</strong> (body lowered), go and comfort him, he may be feeling uneasy.</p>

<p><strong>5. Boss</strong>.</p>

<p>If the dog <strong>holds its ears upwards or forwards</strong> (ears up or forward) <strong>and stares with eyes
wide open</strong> (open eyes stare), <strong>its body is carried tall</strong> (body is carried high), **possibly with
<strong>its tail is held straight up</strong> (tail is standing up) <strong>and
the dog may grunt from a closed mouth</strong>, <strong>it is dominant</strong> (from a closed mouth makes a low growl)
(in a dominant position).</p>
