        <p>Not long ago, Weibo was ablaze with a spoof video from YouTube.</p>

<p>In the cat&rsquo;s first view, a mysterious day goes by unbeknownst to the shovelers.</p>

<p>As soon as the good cat in the video leaves the house-</p>

<p>Money is easy to rob.</p>

<p>The Hammer Man Hammering Away</p>

<p>But what the stupid humans don&rsquo;t know is that the content of this video is actually not all that bad - it&rsquo;s a spoof!</p>

<p>**Your cat at home may have really lived a wild life. **</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t try to monitor your cat, or you might find out: he has more of a nightlife than you do!</p>

<p>Ever since shovelers have been installing pet cameras, people have been discovering another side of their cats.</p>

<p>A small percentage of the results of the surveillance are heartwarming.</p>

<p>For example, people have noticed that their cats are always playing with their pups when humans are not looking.</p>

<p>And the fact that it is their cat who is secretly jerking off the dog at home every day.</p>

<p>Most of the rest of the results, however, apparently left the owner with a bit of a brainache.</p>

<p>There was a story about a man who felt out of breath in his sleep, so he installed a camera to monitor his sleep.</p>

<p>As a result, he discovered that the nightmare that plagued him day after day was actually his own cat squatting on his chest.</p>

<p>In addition, many cat owners have seen the surveillance and realized that the lock they thought was strong is just a trick in the cat&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Opening a door is just a basic feline skill.</p>

<p>Prisoners who often take a shit in the toilet are also caught on camera.</p>

<p>But these are really harmless problems.</p>

<p>The worse shovelers will find their cat is a burglar after installing surveillance.</p>

<p>One foreign shoveler learned from the surveillance at the door that his cat had to steal something every day.</p>

<p>When one discovers that the famous neighborhood shoe thief is actually one&rsquo;s own cat, one may be somewhat devastated.</p>

<p>All in all, installing a camera on your cat is a bit like looking at your target&rsquo;s cell phone - you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t see, you&rsquo;re surprised.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t see anything, you&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s a camera. If you see something, you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;re pretending. If you see something, you&rsquo;ll add to your own problems.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s better to turn a blind eye and enjoy the peace.</p>

<p>House cameras are a good surveillance tool for people who have cats in captivity. But it is still lacking for foreign shovelers who prefer to keep cats on the loose.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why many free-range cat owners have installed GPS trackers on their cats.</p>

<p>Not only do these GPS trackers show the cat&rsquo;s current location to avoid losing it, but they also have the ability to record its movements.</p>

<p>Most shovelers don&rsquo;t think so, thinking that their cats are just walking around the house at most.</p>

<p>In the end, it shows the cat&rsquo;s movements like this.</p>

<p>A shoveler has a cat named &ldquo;Sammy&rdquo;. He thought that Sammy was a house cat and would never leave a kilometer radius.</p>

<p>In the end, he was desperate to find out that his Sammy was a bush explorer.</p>

<p>A research project in South Australia followed more than 400 pet cats to investigate their nocturnal behavior. Most of the cat owners felt that their cats wouldn&rsquo;t go outside and that the study was a waste of time.</p>

<p>** But the results showed that 40% of the cats had a habit of sneaking out into the wild at night. **</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t worry or feel too bad, because some cats are out in the wild and sending a romantic signal at the same time.</p>

<p>The GPS tracker not only uncovered the fact that free-range cats are out in the wild, but also brought to light another heartbreaking truth: Your cat may be cheating on you.</p>

<p>Yes, &ldquo;your cat belongs only to you&rdquo; is probably just wishful thinking.</p>

<p>** In reality, you are just one of its owners. **</p>

<p>A few days ago, a blogger on TIKTOK shared this heartbreaking fact with us. This user has a cat named Jagger at home, who usually seems to be an honest cat.</p>

<p>But after she installed a tracking device on Jagger, she discovered that her pet had been visiting five other houses in addition to his own.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised, this is a common occurrence for cats.</p>

<p>Before GPS was popular, it wasn&rsquo;t that easy to catch a cat cheating on you, and most of the time you had to rely on a few hard-to-find clues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cat suddenly threw up mixed-colored cat food, but I&rsquo;ve been feeding him only brown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A scrappy cat in Mexico was caught cheating on his wife just last year. It lived a double life between two families for a long time until the two owners exchanged letters via cat collar, only to discover the fact that it was being walked on two feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cat has several other homes on my back,&rdquo; is a topic that has become a new kind of cuckold literature among cat lovers abroad.</p>

<p>One user on Reddit, a U.S. bar, asked a heartbreaking question: &ldquo;Did you find out that your cat actually has another home?&rdquo; The majority of the responses were heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Most of the responses were heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Many cat lovers spoke of their own harrowing experiences, grieving like a wife/husband whose lover has cheated on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some. After I brought my two dogs home (about a year ago), I noticed that my cat would occasionally leave for a few days. I also started noticing that it was gaining weight very erratically.
About 6 months ago, I put a note on the cat&rsquo;s collar saying that he already had a home and to please stop feeding him.</p>

<p>The next time he came back, the collar I bought was replaced with another collar. I switched it back, and so on and so forth &hellip;&hellip; I put the cat on my collar and he came back with a new one. &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In recent years, due to the rise of GPS and other monitoring devices, more cats have been caught cheating.</p>

<p>So much so that the internet has started to offer tutorials on how to tell if your cat has cheated on you.</p>

<p>Most cat lovers, however, are no longer surprised by this phenomenon.</p>

<p>If you love a cat, you should love it thoroughly and give it freedom.</p>

<p>The only unforgettable frustration for a cat shoveler is that his cat has a richer life than he does &hellip;&hellip;</p>
