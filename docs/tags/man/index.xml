**Man discovers &amp;ldquo;mystery cave&amp;rdquo;, pours Coke in, and out comes the &amp;ldquo;beast&amp;rdquo;! ***
Burrows are a great hiding place for many creatures. A small anteater was looking for ants when it was discovered by a hyena. The anteater was no match for the hyena and found a burrow when it was about to lose its life, and dug in to avoid the hyena&amp;rsquo;s pursuit.</description>

Report
In the streets of Xi&amp;rsquo;an, Shaanxi Province, one often sees a small dog running along the road pulling an elderly man along.
However, unlike the stories we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before, the dog&amp;rsquo;s owner is not a disabled person, but an able-bodied person.
The dog is also the result of months of deliberate &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; by the old man.
The old man said, the dog is a stray dog, initially picked it up when it was very thin.</description>
