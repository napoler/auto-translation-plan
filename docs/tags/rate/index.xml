There are a lot of rich people in the pet world, and there is a number one price tag. The $375 million German Shepherd, Gunther IV, and also Toby Rimes, the dog world&amp;rsquo;s celebrity poodle, are worth $12 million, one rich and the other impeccably beautiful.
WEALTH
Unlike them, today&amp;rsquo;s story is about a dog who is famous not only for his wealth, but also for his surprising way of being spoiled, for his owner who left a huge inheritance to his dog but not to his grandchildren, which is also the origin of his owner&amp;rsquo;s nickname &amp;ldquo;the queen of miserliness&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I have often seen many users ask questions about the choice of dog food for small dogs, and then go to believe those so-called dog food rankings.
In fact, there is no such thing as a dog food ranking, everyone&amp;rsquo;s consumption budget is different, the best is not necessarily the most suitable for you, the current recognized product quality is better ranking is the summit, craving for this kind of high-end brand is very good.</description>
