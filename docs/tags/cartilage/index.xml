      <description>When you think of short-legged dogs, the first thing that comes to mind is corgi dogs, whose most iconic parts are their short legs and butt! Their short legs and chubby body make them jumpy and happy as they walk. **The Corgi was originally a cattle dog, its name &amp;ldquo;Corgi&amp;rdquo; is Welsh for &amp;ldquo;corrci&amp;rdquo; petite. ** They are light as a feather and agile. Early on, they were used to herd cattle precisely because of their short legs, which prevented them from being kicked by cattle.</description>
