      <description>Recently, the Emergency Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine treated a 54-year-old Tiantai man who died of rabies one year after he was bitten by a wild dog and spent a week in the EICU (Emergency Intensive Care Unit). The lesson of blood and tears is heartbreaking.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I was bitten by a wild dog, how can a person just lose it?</description>
