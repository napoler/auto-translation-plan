      <description>Why are other cats so clingy, but your cat is a bit cold and impersonal?
No matter how nice you are to your cat, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to want to come near you.
In fact, the degree of a cat&amp;rsquo;s clinginess is related to many factors.
For example, the gender of the cat, the temperature of the weather, and whether the cat has needs.
