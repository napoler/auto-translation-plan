      <description>The Daily Mail published an anecdote on Feb. 13 about a dog owner in Las Vegas, Nevada, who aimed a gun at his Beagle and fired two shots.

In the video, the hostess poses with her thumb, index finger and middle finger in the shape of a gun and dubs herself &amp;ldquo;Bang! Bang!&amp;rdquo; The dog is very cooperative and emotional, howling twice as the owner &amp;ldquo;shoots,&amp;rdquo; as if imitating the sad scene in a gunfight movie where the main character is shot and about to collapse, and then collapses on the mat next to her.</description>
