      <description>According to the news just released by Hong Kong Eastweb, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government said on 25 October that it received a poodle whose sample tested positive for the new coronavirus.
According to the department, the poodle is from Tsuen Wan and its owner is a close contact with a confirmed case of neocrowning, so the poodle was sent to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department for quarantine last Friday (20), and the sample taken showed positive results for neocrowning.</description>
