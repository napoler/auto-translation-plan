Report
In the grasslands, a group of hyenas were sharing their catch, and the hungry lions couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but try to grab it.
The hyenas were not vegetarians and would not allow the lions to take their food, so a great battle began.
The lion was so enraged that he had to eat the food that he grew up and fought the hyenas, but could the hyenas really win?</description>
