      <description>** CCTV Finance (reporter Wang Yongxi)** A survey has found that the price of puppies from Britain&amp;rsquo;s most popular breed has reached record levels, according to the website of Sky News UK. According to the data, the average price of a Dachshund rose to £1,838 in June this year, up 89 percent from £973 in March. English and French bulldog prices have also risen sharply. A review of the past three years of advertising on some of Britain&amp;rsquo;s largest classified advertising sites shows that the prices of English pugs, dachshunds and poodles have never been higher.</description>
