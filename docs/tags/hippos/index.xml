      <description>The African wild dog is a very aggressive animal, although the wild dog is not very large and may not seem as big as our domestic dogs. However, the pack nature of the wild dog makes them one of the most important predators on the African savannah, and some people even consider them to be the third top predator in the African savannah besides lions and hyenas.
Wild dog packs are strictly disciplined, preying on animals several times their size through strength in numbers and teamwork.</description>
