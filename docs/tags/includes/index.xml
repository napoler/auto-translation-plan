      <description>Probably one of the most feared and apex predators in sub-Saharan Africa, hyenas possess great strength, jaws capable of crushing bones, a bite second only to saltwater crocodiles and great white sharks, and incredible stamina, intelligence, and absolute strength. In fact, packs of hyenas are so strong that they often challenge lions and leopards, sometimes driving them out of their territory.
Hyenas are mostly scavengers, opportunists, and parasitic predators, meaning they steal food from the prey of other predators.</description>
