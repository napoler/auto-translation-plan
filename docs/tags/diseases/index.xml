I&amp;rsquo;m sure most people really like Garfield! Garfield not only looks cute, but also has a very cute personality. The Garfield I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is super clingy and never messes up, and when there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to do, he just lies quietly by the side and sleeps and stares, so he&amp;rsquo;s really a good pet. However, my friends who have had cats for many years have told me that many people are actually reluctant to raise Garfield, although they are indeed very pleasant to look at, but they can&amp;rsquo;t afford to do so because they are too realistic.</description>
