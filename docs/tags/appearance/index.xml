However, there is one kind of dog that looks bitter and unhappy, and this kind of dog is the Pug.
At first glance, the black face and furrowed brow of a pug always make you think that it is unhappy, and you can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel an urge to protect it. However, the personality of the Pug has nothing to do with this world-weary, sad appearance.</description>

      <title> The cute and sweet Teddy is a hound, but it&#39;s a good thing I didn&#39;t mess with him, or else I&#39;d be in trouble! </title>

Would you believe it if someone told you that your Teddy is actually a hunting dog? I know most people think it&amp;rsquo;s impossible, but how can a small, litter-ridden dog be a ferocious hound? Let me tell you then, based on the history of the Teddy&amp;rsquo;s origins and the tracing of its lineage, it really is a terrier.
For the record, the Teddy is not a breed of dog, it&amp;rsquo;s just one of the dogs of the Poodle, just like one of the lipstick shades.</description>
