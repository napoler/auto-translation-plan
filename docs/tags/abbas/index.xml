      <description>The city has a long history of peaceful coexistence with hyenas. Centuries ago, these animals attacked people, sometimes even biting the townspeople to death. Then people made holes in the walls and threw food scraps in the holes, so the hyenas started to eat the rest of the food and stopped attacking people. According to the Harar people, there has not been another hyena attack on humans for 200 years.</description>
