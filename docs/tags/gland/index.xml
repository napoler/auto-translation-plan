      <description>Only by getting to know it can you make it like you more.
Careful shovelers may find that, for a cat that is not yet familiar or bad-tempered, or when the owner is not in a good mood, touching its belly, paws, tail and other sensitive parts of the cat is likely to result in a beating.
Cat: Don&amp;rsquo;t touch me!
But touching the top of the head and chin usually does not attract &amp;ldquo;blood&amp;rdquo;, as if the top of the head and chin is the &amp;ldquo;immunity zone&amp;rdquo; of the shovel.</description>
