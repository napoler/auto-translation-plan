Report
What a beautiful picture of the sky and the wilderness, the grass blowing in the wind and the cows and sheep. If possible, the veterinarian would like to get away from the chaotic city and go to the grassland to graze cattle and sheep. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what kind of environment you live in, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be open-minded, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;ve all heard of sheepdogs, so has anyone heard of sheepdogs and cats?</description>
