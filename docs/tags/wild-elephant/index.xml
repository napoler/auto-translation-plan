Report
In the food chain, herbivores have an instinctive fear of carnivores. In general, herbivores will choose to hide when they encounter carnivores. The wild elephant is dozens of times the size of a pet cat, so is the pet cat too fierce, or is the wild elephant too alert?
Description: The elephant is a wild male elephant. The elephant is also quite famous in the area, because at night, this elephant will go around breaking into people&amp;rsquo;s homes, looking for food, the local residents can not do anything, because wild elephants are protected animals, can only notify the relevant authorities, to drive it into the jungle again, but can not harm the elephant.</description>
