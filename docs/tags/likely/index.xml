      <description>Only by getting to know it can you make it like you more.
Careful shovelers may find that, for a cat that is not yet familiar or bad-tempered, or when the owner is not in a good mood, touching its belly, paws, tail and other sensitive parts of the cat is likely to result in a beating.
Cat: Don&amp;rsquo;t touch me!
But touching the top of the head and chin usually does not attract &amp;ldquo;blood&amp;rdquo;, as if the top of the head and chin is the &amp;ldquo;immunity zone&amp;rdquo; of the shovel.</description>

      <description>Probably one of the most feared and apex predators in sub-Saharan Africa, hyenas possess great strength, jaws capable of crushing bones, a bite second only to saltwater crocodiles and great white sharks, and incredible stamina, intelligence, and absolute strength. In fact, packs of hyenas are so strong that they often challenge lions and leopards, sometimes driving them out of their territory.
Hyenas are mostly scavengers, opportunists, and parasitic predators, meaning they steal food from the prey of other predators.</description>
