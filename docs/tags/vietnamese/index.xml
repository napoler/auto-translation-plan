      <description>Dui, a Vietnamese dog, has quickly become popular on the Internet because it looks like a cat and is very cute, with netizens calling it &amp;ldquo;the funniest ball of fur&amp;rdquo; and speculating about its breed, according to a Feb. 26 report in the British newspaper Metro.
Dui is a cross between a Corgi and a Vietnamese Hmong dog, and some joked that he might be a mix of a Corgi and an English Shorthair.</description>
