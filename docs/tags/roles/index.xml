      <description>One drama that just aired and attracted a large number of fans and is now a household name is &amp;ldquo;Baolian Lantern&amp;rdquo;. When this drama was aired, the response was really great. The drama tells the story of the man, Shen Xiang, who uses an axe to chop the mountain to save his mother. Because of this drama, a lot of people have been fired, for example, the lead role of Erlang Shen, played by Jiao Junen, whose outstanding appearance made the audience think that he was the original Erlang Shen.</description>
