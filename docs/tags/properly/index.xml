      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s important to be prepared before getting a dog!
**1, do not think that raising a dog is an easy thing **, although the dog can bring you a lot of happy time, but if you will not raise a dog, it will certainly bring you a lot of trouble.
2, before raising a dog, first consider their current living situation, whether the dog can provide a stable living environment, whether you have the economic strength to raise a dog, many college students on a whim, in the dormitory dog, in fact, this is very wrong, as long as you graduate, there is a certain economic strength, and a stable place to live and then proceed to consider raising a little guy!</description>
