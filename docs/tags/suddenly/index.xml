      <description>For example, a domestic cat will become a stray cat after being abandoned, and a stray cat will gradually become a domestic cat after being adopted, so in everyone&amp;rsquo;s subconscious mind, stray cats and domestic cats are the same kind of animal.
But as I understand more and more about stray cats, I find that stray cats and domestic cats are simply 2 different kinds of animals.
Because stray cats are so smart, they sometimes do things that would surprise a human being like me, but recently, I was shocked by a stray cat, and it happened to me.</description>
