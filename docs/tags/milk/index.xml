      <description>A few days ago, I found a hot search on Weibo: #Yang Gao&amp;rsquo;s cat is lost#.
It is known that the golden gradient layer, called Tangerine, is a little baby raised by Yang Gao.
But on November 11, the little tangerine, which was placed in a relative&amp;rsquo;s home, suddenly ran away from home.
When she learned the news, her sister sent out a message at midnight asking for help: &amp;ldquo;Just be safe and don&amp;rsquo;t wander the streets!</description>

      <description>When you first start to breed a Corgi, you don&amp;rsquo;t even realize that sometimes the actions of the pet owners may harm the dog. Therefore, we advise pet owners that they should not continue to keep their Corgi like this, or they will only harm their Corgi!
Not taking Corgi out for sports
Although Corgi is short-legged, he used to be a cattle dog, but his physical activity level is as good as any other dog&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
