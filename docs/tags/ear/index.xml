Report
There are quite a few pet owners in China who have Beagles, and Petsky has met some Beagles and their owners in animal hospitals. ** Too lively! Too lively! Too lively! (Important point, say it three times.) **
In an animal hospital, you can come across all kinds of dogs, and almost all of them have their own unique characteristics that will make an impression on you in one way or another.</description>
