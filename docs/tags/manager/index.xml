      <description>The number of stray dogs without an owner is soaring, and the dog problem is poking at the city management &amp;ldquo;pain points &amp;ldquo;.
Dog control becomes the new test of urban civilization.
The reason why stray dogs have gradually become a &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; in many cities is that owners have abandoned their dogs, lost their pets, and the uncontrolled breeding of stray dogs.
