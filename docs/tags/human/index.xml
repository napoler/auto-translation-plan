I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you have seen Planet of the Apes, Rise of the Planet of the Apes and other Hollywood blockbusters, in which the gorilla warriors also left a deep impression on everyone. In terms of individual power, humans are far less powerful than these animals. If we could use the power of the orangutan for human beings, we could create a group of &amp;ldquo;super soldiers&amp;rdquo;.</description>
