A Dog Named Prince
Recently, a set of four-panel cartoons featuring Koji &amp;ldquo;The Prince&amp;rdquo; has been released. The cartoon uses an anthropomorphic approach to tell the story of &amp;ldquo;Prince&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous moments and spoofs on his daily life, with a cute image and humorous writing style that makes people shout &amp;ldquo;I want more! &amp;ldquo;
Koji&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;short legs&amp;rdquo; has always been a popular &amp;ldquo;nudging point&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;notch&amp;rdquo; used as a joke.</description>

      <description>The Daily Mail published an anecdote on Feb. 13 about a dog owner in Las Vegas, Nevada, who aimed a gun at his Beagle and fired two shots.
__
In the video, the hostess poses with her thumb, index finger and middle finger in the shape of a gun and dubs herself &amp;ldquo;Bang! Bang!&amp;rdquo; The dog is very cooperative and emotional, howling twice as the owner &amp;ldquo;shoots,&amp;rdquo; as if imitating the sad scene in a gunfight movie where the main character is shot and about to collapse, and then collapses on the mat next to her.</description>
