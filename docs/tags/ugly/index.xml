Report
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ugly dogs, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen such an ugly dog, they say bulldogs are already very ugly, but after seeing this dog, I found that bulldogs are already quite beautiful dogs, this dog is dark and ugly.
Of course, although this dog is very ugly, the owner also likes it, so he likes its ugliness.
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s interest is different, although the dog is ugly, but still acceptable range, unlike some people have pigs as pets, that is really a bit unbearable, after all, the dog is still man&amp;rsquo;s best friend.</description>
