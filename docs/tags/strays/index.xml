      <description>Originally I am the extraordinary gentleman.
About 50 kilometers from downtown Shanghai, Fengxian hides an old and dilapidated temple called the Annunciation Temple.
Unlike temples in the downtown area, there is no golden-hued palace, no solemn monks in robes, and no chanting of Buddhist scriptures.
But there is a monk in a red auto mechanic&amp;rsquo;s uniform who has rescued more than 5,500 stray dogs and cats.
This man is the abbot of the hospital, Zhixiang.</description>
