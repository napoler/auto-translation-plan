      <description>A few days ago, I found a hot search on Weibo: #Yang Gao&amp;rsquo;s cat is lost#.
It is known that the golden gradient layer, called Tangerine, is a little baby raised by Yang Gao.
But on November 11, the little tangerine, which was placed in a relative&amp;rsquo;s home, suddenly ran away from home.
When she learned the news, her sister sent out a message at midnight asking for help: &amp;ldquo;Just be safe and don&amp;rsquo;t wander the streets!</description>

      <description>For example, a domestic cat will become a stray cat after being abandoned, and a stray cat will gradually become a domestic cat after being adopted, so in everyone&amp;rsquo;s subconscious mind, stray cats and domestic cats are the same kind of animal.
But as I understand more and more about stray cats, I find that stray cats and domestic cats are simply 2 different kinds of animals.
Because stray cats are so smart, they sometimes do things that would surprise a human being like me, but recently, I was shocked by a stray cat, and it happened to me.</description>
