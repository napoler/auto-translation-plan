      <description>The Daily Mail published an anecdote on Feb. 13 about a dog owner in Las Vegas, Nevada, who aimed a gun at his Beagle and fired two shots.
__
In the video, the hostess poses with her thumb, index finger and middle finger in the shape of a gun and dubs herself &amp;ldquo;Bang! Bang!&amp;rdquo; The dog is very cooperative and emotional, howling twice as the owner &amp;ldquo;shoots,&amp;rdquo; as if imitating the sad scene in a gunfight movie where the main character is shot and about to collapse, and then collapses on the mat next to her.</description>

Report
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ugly dogs, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen such an ugly dog, they say bulldogs are already very ugly, but after seeing this dog, I found that bulldogs are already quite beautiful dogs, this dog is dark and ugly.
Of course, although this dog is very ugly, the owner also likes it, so he likes its ugliness.
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s interest is different, although the dog is ugly, but still acceptable range, unlike some people have pigs as pets, that is really a bit unbearable, after all, the dog is still man&amp;rsquo;s best friend.</description>
