Report
This distinctive husky made its debut on the social world section of the social media site Instagram. Unlike other huskies, this dog has a husky body and sapphire blue eyes, but his hair is brown. It&amp;rsquo;s very new, and it looks like a gray tree trunk.
&amp;ldquo;The Quoi Husky is actually not exactly brown in appearance. It still has a small white spot on its chest, and how many huskies do you see that look like it?</description>
