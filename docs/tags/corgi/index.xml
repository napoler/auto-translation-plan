Report
The Corgi is very cute, easy to take care of, and takes up little time. The Corgi&amp;rsquo;s IQ is also very high, and he will quickly learn to master any skill he is taught, especially his appearance, and he is very good at playing tricks.
Looking online, I learned that there are roughly three types of Corgi: the first Cardigan-Welsh Corgi, the second Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and the third Swedish Corgi.</description>
