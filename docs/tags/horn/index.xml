      <description>There are many animals in the world that run. The lion, for example, is the most dominant animal of the African savannah and is known as the &amp;ldquo;King of the Beasts&amp;rdquo;. But what most people don&amp;rsquo;t know is that lions are also very fast. Most of the time, fast running animals will dare to hunt prey that runs at the same or even much faster than them. Do you know what the fastest animals are?</description>
