      <description>Last Saturday night, a pack of African wild dogs broke out of their enclosure at the West Midlands Safari Park and killed 16 sheep and deer at the zoo, including 10 Persian fallow deer and six barbarian sheep, according to the British newspaper The Sun.
When the keepers arrived at the scene of the incident, they were shocked by the bloodshed that had taken place.
A door separating the dogs from the other animals was blown down by high winds due to the storm of the century, and then 12 of the dogs ran into the living quarters of the other animals and carried out a horrific, dog-less slaughter.</description>
