      <description>As people&amp;rsquo;s standard of living is getting better and better, the number of families with pet dogs is increasing, and lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing postings/questions from people asking about Beagles. It just so happens that recently I have received two surrogate training Beagles here, and I&amp;rsquo;ll state in advance that I have no previous experience with breeding or training Beagles, and this is my first experience with them, so today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about what I know about Beagles!</description>
