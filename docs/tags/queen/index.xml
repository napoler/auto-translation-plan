Report
On the evening of November 25, local time, King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Sultan Suthep attended the Rama VI ceremony.
Queen Suthep&amp;rsquo;s jewelry looked exactly the same as the day before when she went to the Sirikit Foundation on official business, and although the jewelry remained the same, the change in clothing was very obvious.
Queen Sirikit&amp;rsquo;s jewelry is unmatched by the Queen&amp;rsquo;s collection, but her incomparable gems are not available to the wife of the current king.</description>
