      <description>I have to say that this face clash of wolves is really a fan&amp;rsquo;s brain, Xiao Zhan fans do not know that some time ago, Wang Hailin also took His Highness Hashchi a wave of Xiao Zhan connotation?
This kind of gives Xiao Zhan the feeling of taking a seat, but Xiao Zhan not only clashed with the husky, but also clashed with the gourd baby&amp;rsquo;s sleeping pose, so I have to say that Xiao Zhan is instantly very cute.</description>
