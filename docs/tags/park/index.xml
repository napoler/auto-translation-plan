      <description>Incheon District Court
A 74-year-old Korean man, Park Mok, adopted two dogs and promised the owners that he would &amp;ldquo;treat them like children,&amp;rdquo; but unexpectedly he killed the dogs less than two hours after adopting them and made them into a &amp;ldquo;tonic soup. On November 23, the Incheon District Court sentenced Mr. Park to six months in prison for &amp;ldquo;fraud&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;violating animal protection laws. However, this did not quell the public&amp;rsquo;s anger, as more than 62,000 Korean netizens have so far petitioned on the Cheong Wa Dae petition board, demanding that he be severely punished.</description>
