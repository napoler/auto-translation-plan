      <description>Galactic Combat 2 has officially aired, and in this story we see the appearance of the mysterious Tartarus. Of course, in the first story, Tartarus did nothing more than praise the Land of Light, and then disappeared again. The most miserable character in the first story is Max, who is not very lucky and encounters the Slann, the fiercest beast Herberos, the serpent Morgul, and Gordis.
In the preview of the second story, Gothic Ultraman and Justus Ultraman finally appear, a pair that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been on stage together since they fought side by side in the theatrical version of Gothic Ultraman.</description>
